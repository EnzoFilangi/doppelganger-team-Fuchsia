# Doppelganger

*Goal*: learn about the various types of test doubles

## Instructions

There are bugs in the code (marked with a `Bug!` comment), but all the
tests are passing.

For each test, you will find a `TODO` comment. Your job
is to implement a test double for each test, and to use it
to make the test fail for the right reason, i.e, triggering
the bugs. You must do so by **adding only test code** - you
are not allowed to change the production code.

## Team

We are team Fuchsia, composed of :

- Damien HUANG
- Enzo FILANGI
- Faris CHTATOU
- Priestley DECELIAN
- Sami EL BAIED

We choose to work in JavaScript for this Kata

## Step 1 - without any library

For this step, you are *not* allowed to use an external library. You have to implement
the interfaces "by hand".

## Step 2 - with a library

Use a library like `mockito` to rewrite all the tests.

Which version do you prefer?
